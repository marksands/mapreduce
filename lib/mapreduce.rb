# requirements:
#   Redis
#   Resque
#   Resque-scheduler
#   json parser
# 
# Notes:
#   - Instead of calling "emit_intermediate"/"emit" in your map/reduce to
#     produce a key value pair/value you call yield, which will call
#     emit_intermediate/emit for you.  This gives flexibility in using
#     Mapper/Reducer classes especially in testing.
#
# not necessarily in the given order
# TODO: * if a job fails we do what we are supposed to do
#         i.e. add a failure_hook which does something if your job fails
#       * add an on finish hook or something to notify the user when the program
#         finishes
#       * include functionality for a partitioner
#       * include functionality for a combiner 
#       * implement this shit so that we can run mapreduce commands from
#         the command line.  Defining any arbitrary mapper and reducer.
#      ** implement redundant workers (workers doing the same work in case one of them fails)
# ******* edit emit for when we have multiple workers doing the same reduce
#         (redundant workers for fault tolerance might need to change
#         the rpush to a lock and setting of just a value)
#         even if other workers do work on the same answer, want to make sure
#         that the final reduced thing is the same every time
#   ***** Add fault tolerance, better tracking of which workers fail, especially
#         when we have multiple workers doing the same work
#         ... currently is handled by Resque failure auto retry
#     *** if a perform operation fails then we need to have worker recover
#       * make use of finish_metrics somewhere so that we can have statistics on how
#         long map reduce jobs take
#    **** better tracking of work being assigned so we can know when a job is finished
#         or in progress and have a trigger to do things when shit finishes
#         - in resque there is functionality for an after hook
#           which performs something after your job does it's work
#       * ensure reducers only do a fixed amount of work
#         See section 3.2 of paper. bookkeeping
#         that tells the master when tasks are in-progress or completed.
#         this will be important for better paralleziation of tasks
#  ****** think about the following logic
#         if a reducer starts working on a key after all maps have finished
#           then when it is done the work on that key is finished forerver
#         this would imply a job finishes when all map tasks have finished
#           and all reduce tasks that start after the map tasks have finished
#         if a reducer started before all map tasks were finished, then
#           load its reduced result back onto the value list
#         if the reducer started after all map tasks finished, then emit
#           the result
#     *** refactor manager/master so that master talks to a "filesystem" (we'll create this filesystem module/class)
