module MapReduce
  # Reduce is a function that takes in "all" the values for a single given key
  # and outputs a list of values or a single value that usually "reduces"
  # the initial given value set.
  #
  # The output of the reduce shall always be
  #   reduce(values) = [ reduced value, reduced value, ... ]
  # and it will often only be a single element array
  #
  # The input values and the output values of the reduce will always
  # be a string. As described in the paper, it is up to the client
  # to define how to deal with this restriction.
  #
  class Reducer < QueueProcess
    
    # Ensure all mappers finished their work before reducers started doing work./
    # Skewed distributions would be dealt with a combiner, help deal with reducers doing too much work.
    # Don't have to worry about associativity.
    # 
    # All the values for a given key are process by a single reduce.
    # Fault tolerance and redundancy are not handled.
    # 
    # When a reduce is made, if it finishes then the reduce operation for that key is complete.
